## What is this repo about?

PyTorch code and [streamlit app]() that demonstrate how easy it is to break deep learning models in computer vision.
More precisely, Inception V3.

If you do not know what adversarial examples are go check my blog post.

## Quick setup

[TODO]

## Fast Gradient Sign method

We use the vanilla fast gradient sign method

And its iterative version.

In the code you can find the "magic" that transforms a nice puppy into a paper towel.
